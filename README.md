Hello, my name is Vimal Vinod. I am a Mathematics Undergraduate at the University of Warwick. ðŸŒ±<br>

I recently completed an app called Mai Waifu. It's programmed in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose and allows you to click through images of cute female anime/manga/video game characters fetched from the Waifu.im API. The latest version allows you to filter by tags.<br>

Have a look at my <a href="https://dalekvim.github.io/mai-waifu/">GitHub Repo</a> if that sounds interesting to you. ðŸ”­
The app is available to download on the Google Play Store.
<br>

Collaborations and ideas are welcome. ðŸ‘¯<br>

You can contact me with any of the socials on my profile or email me at dalekvim@gmail.com. ðŸ“«
