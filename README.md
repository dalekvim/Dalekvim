Hello, my name is Vimal Vinod. I am an undergraduate at the University of Warwick. ðŸŒ±<br>

I am currently working on an app called Mai Waifu. It's programmed with React Native and shows you images of cute female anime/manga/video game characters from the Waifu.im API.
Have a look at my <a href="https://dalekvim.github.io/mai-waifu/">GitHub Repo</a> if that sounds interesting to you. ðŸ”­<br>

Collaborations and ideas are welcome. ðŸ‘¯<br>

You can contact me with any of the socials on my profile or email me at dalekvim@gmail.com. ðŸ“«
