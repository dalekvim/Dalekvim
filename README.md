Hi, my name is Vimal Vinod. I am a student at the University of Warwick.<br>
I am currently working on an app called Mai Waifu which shows you images of cute female anime/manga/video game characters.
Have a look at my <a href="https://dalekvim.github.io/mai-waifu/">GitHub Repo</a> if that sounds interesting to you. ðŸ”­<br>
